### ¡👋 Hello there 👋!
- I'm Joseph. A scientist working in New York. My goal is to deeply understand foundational ideas from key areas of knowledge that, I believe, will define the rest of this century. To that end, I spend most of my (free?) time actively thinking about these topics:
    1. 🤔 The fate of artificial nations (A term that I use to refer to nations created as colonial units). I'm interested in how to reclaim what was lost.
    2. 🤔 How the intersection of computer science and molecular biology will allow us to feed the world & heal the world -- can we speed up the process of creating new cultivars? can we create high fidelity computational models of non-infectious diseases?
    
- 📚 Sometimes, after I refine a few thoughts on the first topic, I document them in an infrequently updated substack that you can find [here](https://sauti.substack.com/).
- 📚 I also keep a public notebook in which I distill key ideas from computer science. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/jlikhuva/blog)
- 😄 Fun fact: I use [notion as a fancy (not really) bookmark manager](https://www.notion.so/Live-Edification-List-56d437d50e904def8ea447141b980852) to keep track of interesting texts (papers, and book chapters) and blog posts. Oh! and I like holstein heifers and cats!!
